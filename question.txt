9. Enhance the Map Reduce program of Task 8 (refer session 6, assignment 1) to use multiple reducers for sorting.

Use units sold as key and company as value.
Write a custom partitioner to divide the keys on the basis of range.
Take minimum to be 0 and maximum to be 10. Divide them across 2 reducers.
